# What I’m Looking for in My First Tech Role

*A candid note from a final-year AIML student*

I’m not chasing buzzwords or titles. I’m looking for an environment where I can learn, contribute, and grow as an engineer.

What I value in my first role:

* Exposure to real systems
* Mentorship from engineers who care about quality
* Problems that don’t have clean answers
* Space to learn fast and take ownership

I’m comfortable admitting what I don’t know, but I take responsibility for learning it.

I believe good engineers are built by debugging hard problems, reading other people’s code, making mistakes, and asking why instead of just how.

If you’re a team that values curiosity, clarity, and execution, I’d love to work with you.
