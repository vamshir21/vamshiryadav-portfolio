# From a Tier-3 College to Real-World AI Engineering

*Why building beats certificates every single time*

Most students believe cracking AI/ML means finishing courses, collecting certificates, and hoping recruiters notice. I believed that too—until I started building.

Coming from a tier-3 college, I realized early that my resume would never win on brand name alone. The only leverage I had was proof of work. That meant projects that actually run, break, scale, and get fixed.

Instead of chasing “perfect knowledge,” I focused on:

* Building end-to-end systems
* Deploying models, not just training them
* Writing backend APIs that real users could hit
* Understanding *why* something fails, not just *how* to code it

This mindset changed everything.

Recruiters don’t care how many ML courses you finished. They care whether you can reason about trade-offs, understand system boundaries, and ship something usable.

If you’re from a non-elite college, don’t compete on theory alone. Compete on execution.
