# Learning Backend Engineering as an AIML Student

*Why every ML engineer needs backend skills*

Early on, I realized something uncomfortable: a model that isn’t deployed is useless.

That’s when I started learning backend engineering seriously.

Instead of jumping between frameworks, I focused on fundamentals:

* HTTP and request–response cycles
* REST API design
* FastAPI for model serving
* Data validation and error handling
* Basic DevOps concepts

My rule was simple: if I build a model, I must expose it as an API.

This forced me to think in systems, not notebooks. I had to handle real inputs, optimize performance, and understand how clients consume ML outputs.

Backend skills turned my ML projects into products, not demos.

If you’re an AIML student ignoring backend engineering, you’re limiting your impact.
