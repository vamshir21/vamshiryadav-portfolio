Building a portfolio is more than shipping a website — it is a chance to show how you think, plan, and deliver.

## 1. Establish the requirements
I started with a clear checklist: a clean one-page layout, sections mapped directly to my resume, and a blog that supports Markdown content. That kept the experience recruiter-friendly while still leaving room for detail.

## 2. Design with clarity
I chose a minimalist visual style with strong typography, generous spacing, and a neutral palette. This keeps the focus on the content while still feeling modern and professional.

## 3. Build with Next.js + Tailwind
Next.js App Router gave me a reliable structure, while Tailwind CSS helped me move fast with consistent spacing and component rhythm. The content is stored in Markdown so that adding future posts is frictionless.

## 4. Ship to Vercel
The site is deployed on Vercel using the default Next.js build command. Every push to the `main` branch triggers a deployment, which keeps the site always up to date.

## 5. Keep it iterative
I plan to continue iterating on this portfolio as I build new projects and learn new technologies.
